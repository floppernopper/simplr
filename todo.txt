Simplr - To do list

XP should fade in and out, maybe between different colors

XP should be rewarded for simple things like being followed, first posts, creating a group and it becoming popular, or even setting your profile picture for the first time

XP and Tier should still correspond as closely as possible to the powers one has unlocked

Every treasure should return XP, whether or not it returns any kind of power

Potential powers to unlock temporarily:
  Read private messages of other people
  Suspend users accounts for a day
  Edit peoples posts or profiles, reverts back next day
  Rare drop: Shutdown entire site, ability to replace home page with uploaded image
  
Potential counter measures to powers unlocked:
  One-click encryption to keep private messages private
  Show eyeballs reading messages, ability to poke an eye out
