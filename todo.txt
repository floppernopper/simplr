Simplr - To do list

XP should fade in and out, maybe between different colors

XP should be rewarded for simple things like being followed, first posts, creating a group and it becoming popular, or even setting your profile picture for the first time

XP and Tier should still correspond as closely as possible to the powers one has unlocked
