Simplr - To do list

XP bar on profiles, progress to next Tier

XP should be rewarded for simple things:
  first post
  being followed
  creating a group and it becoming popular
  using a trending hashtag for the first time
  setting your profile picture for the first time

XP and Tier should still correspond as closely as possible to the powers one has unlocked
XP should fade in and out, maybe between different colors when rewarded
Every treasure should return XP, whether or not it returns any kind of power

Potential powers to unlock temporarily:
  Read private messages of other people
  Invade any private groups (without request)
  Edit peoples posts, groups, or profiles, reverts back next day
  Rare drop: Shutdown entire site, ability to replace home page with uploaded image
  
Potential counter measures to powers unlocked:
  One-click encryption to keep private messages private
  Show eyeballs reading messages, ability to poke an eye out
  Use back up password to revert changes to profile or posts
