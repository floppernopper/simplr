## Simplr - To do list

Priority:
  Fix infinite scroll overload glitch
  Icons for loot items and powers drawn with MS Paint
  Less destructive, neutral powers to unlock
  Level up animation at the top with fader
  Progress bar count up xp at page load
  XP count up to total received
  See who liked your post
  Implement powers

Think of names for site, ideas and words to play on:
  Kal√≥, Omcircle, etc.....
  Mythological, Esoteric
  Psychedelic, Trippy
  Ambient, Ambience
  Buddhist/Hindu
  Party site
  Cyberpunk
  Vaporwave

Like/Dislike/Voting system:
  There needs to be a simple way for users to show opinion of posts, comments, etc.
  Potential forms:
    Up/down voting system like Reddit has
    Like alternatives: Kudos, Props, Nice
    Multi-disposition system using icons
    Ability to like stuff more than once

User profiles:
  Profile card should be shrunk and left aligned with the progress bar right aligned next to it
  Progress bar should also be wider than the profile card, which should be squared
  
A mini game of some kind, like a card game, something that could be used dynamically as a template, over and over with different themes, so there'd be more than just QA challenges for treasure looting

Loot drops (items, trinkets, emblems, gold):
  Emblems for stylizing posts
  Gold, gems, currency for trade
  Inventory for managing loot collected
  Armor, weapons, etc for beefing up profiles
  Emblems for stylizing avatars and user cards
  Loot drops to be separate from powers unlocked
  Icons for loot items to be drawn with MS Paint
  Item sets, once complete, a power is unlocked
  Ability to trade loot items, even for powers

XP should be rewarded for simple things:
  first post
  being followed
  creating a group and it becoming popular
  using a trending hashtag for the first time
  setting your profile picture for the first time

XP and Tier should still correspond as closely as possible to the powers one has unlocked
Every treasure should return XP, whether or not it returns any kind of power

Potential types of treasure and themes to play on:
  Greeted by a Sphinx with a riddle that leads to another treasure
  Mazes of hidden pages (treasure) linking to one another
  Ancient mythology themed treasure and riddles
  Pop culture/internet meme questions/riddles
  Lord of the Rings references

Potential powers to unlock:
  Ability to Dislike posts
  Take someone elses power(s)
  Make someone start following you
  Read private messages of other people
  See who's seeing your posts or comments
  Invade any private groups (without request)
  Steal peoples followers, reassigns them to you
  Rare drop: Shutdown entire site, ability to replace home page with uploaded image
  
Potential counter measures to powers unlocked:
  One-click encryption to keep private messages private
  Show eyeballs reading messages, ability to poke an eye out
  Use back up password to revert changes to profile or posts
  
Users should be able to trade powers with other users

A heart beat visualization for site activity, similar to the standard heart rate monitor in hospitals
