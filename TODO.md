## Simplr - To do list

Priority:
  Level up animation at the top with fader
  Progress bar count up xp at page load
  XP count up to total received
  Implement powers

Think of names for site, ideas and words to play on:
  Awecity, AweCity, Aweciti
  Kalo (greek for invite)
  Mythological, Esoteric
  Eclectica, Eclectico
  Psychedelic, Trippy
  Ambient, Ambience

User profiles:
  Profile card should be shrunk and left aligned with the progress bar right aligned next to it
  Progress bar should also be wider than the profile card, which should be squared
  
A mini game of some kind, like a card game, something that could be used dynamically as a template, over and over with different themes, so there'd be more than just QA challenges for treasure looting

Power to grant access to leveling system, xp, unlocking powers (except Discover), hidden treasure, etc.
All of the above inaccessible until Discover power unlocked (door to all doors to all mazes to all prizes)

Loot drops (items, trinkets, emblems, gold):
  Emblems for stylizing posts
  Gold, gems, currency for trade
  Inventory for managing loot collected
  Armor, weapons, etc for beefing up profiles
  Emblems for stylizing avatars and user cards
  Loot drops to be separate from powers unlocked

XP should be rewarded for simple things:
  first post
  being followed
  creating a group and it becoming popular
  using a trending hashtag for the first time
  setting your profile picture for the first time

XP and Tier should still correspond as closely as possible to the powers one has unlocked
Every treasure should return XP, whether or not it returns any kind of power

Potential types of treasure and themes to play on:
  Greeted by a Sphinx with a riddle that leads to another treasure
  Mazes of hidden pages (treasure) linking to one another
  Ancient mythology themed treasure and riddles
  Lord of the Rings references

Potential powers to unlock temporarily:
  Read private messages of other people
  Invade any private groups (without request)
  Edit peoples posts, groups, or profiles, reverts back next day
  Rare drop: Shutdown entire site, ability to replace home page with uploaded image
  
Potential counter measures to powers unlocked:
  One-click encryption to keep private messages private
  Show eyeballs reading messages, ability to poke an eye out
  Use back up password to revert changes to profile or posts
